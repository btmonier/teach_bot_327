# Overview
Today is proposal development for the nitrogen experiment for the second half
of the lab semester (Cyanobacterium as potential nitrogen fertilizer).

# Procedures
* Ask them what they went over last time we met (before spring break).
    - If they are completely forgetful about the last lab, give them about
      three minutes to come up with some conclusions
* Next, give them about *40 to 50* minutes to come up with a proposal:
    - The plants they will use will be maize (corn),
    - The experiment *must* revolve around infiltrating the leaf tissue
      using vacuum (negative pressure) as an ifiltration device,
    - Have them go over their questions that they went over last week,
    - What variables will they measure?
    - They have two weeks for their experimentation this time
    - After two weeks, they will harvest the experiment
    - Make sure they use a minimum of 3 replications per treatment
    - All experimentation will be conducted in the greenhouse
    - Show them the vacuum chamber and pump (heavy!)
    - The vacuum will draw all of the air out of the leaf. When the 
      air comes back in, so will the cyanobacteria (in theory)
    - Make sure they understand that this is a potentially violent
      process and may damage the plant (potentially experiment around this)
    - The pressure that our vacuum can go to is about 1 bar
