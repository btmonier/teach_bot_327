# Overview

* Today, these students will create experiments studying the effects of
gravitropsim.

* Based on preliminary results, design one simple experiment to test **one factor**
  for each group.

* Design an experiment and we will look over to see if this feasible.

* **Design, design, design** 

* Create proposal

* Group lab reports 


# General observations

* Have groups discuss experimental designs pertaining to gravitropism.

* Go around to each group and talk to them.

* We do have light filters if they want to test for phototropism.

* All experimentation will be performed in the teaching lab. 

* Emphasize controls (i.e. something to compare their treatments to).

*
