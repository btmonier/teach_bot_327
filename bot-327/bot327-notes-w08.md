# Overview
Today is the third lab for the cyanobacteria experiment. This is where 
the students will conduct the first part of the experiment.  

## Procedures
* This lab will be conducted entirely in the greenhouse
* The variables that they will measure will be leaf length and leaf number
    - Each leaf will be measured
    - Make sure they note each leaf!
* The major time-sink for this project is the cyanobacteria infiltration
  procedure
    - We can only fit two maize replicates in at a time
    - We only have one chamber...
    - Approximate time for completion: **2-3 hours**
    - After they have finished their infiltration procedures, they are free to
      go.
* For next week's lab (2018-03-27), we will only be performing 3 objectives:
    - Measure leaf length
    - Count leaf number
    - Apply respective nutrient solutions for each treatment
