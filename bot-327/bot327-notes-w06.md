# Overview
* Students will conduct a "literature review" over the material for the
  next experimental portion of lab.

* The next experiment will involve nitrogen fixation in cyanobacteria
  and how we can implement this into plants to see if we can obtain
  higher plant vigor.

* First, we will give a brief overview of what is going on.

* Next, they will have to answer a battery of questions by using several 
  sources of literature, namely, two papers, and the text book (Chapter 11).


# Questions
1. Why are we interested in biological nitrogen fixation?
2. What are the two major forms of biological nitrogen fixation?
3. What are the different strategies evolved in organisms to deal with the
   sensitivity of dinitrogenase to oxygen?
4. What are the Nod factors and their functions?
5. What are *nif* genes and their functions?
6. How can we take advantage of biological nitrogen fixation in crop
   production? What are some of the challenges?
7. List potential advantages and challenges of using cyanobacteria as a 
   biological nitrogen fertilizer in crop production over symbiotic nitrogen
   fixation.

# Additional notes
* This concept may seem complicated to a lot of students...
* Some follow up questions that could be brought up...
    - How do we apply cyanobacteria?
    - **Where** do we apply cyanobacteria?
    - Advantages of leaf and root inoculation?
    - Potential problems with leaf and root inoculation?
    - How do we get it to stay on the leaf? In the leaf?
